# general colorschemes
some base16 colorschemes:
atelier-seaside, brewer, cupertino, everforest-dark-hard, macintosh, google-dark, measured-light, oxocarbon-dark, papercolor-dark, papercolor-light, pico, pop, primer-dark, selenized-white, spacemacs, standarized-light, still-alive, tube, tokyodark, windows-10, windows-nt
base24 colorschemes:
brogrammer, catppuccin-latte (light), deep-oceanic-next, flat, hardcore, one-black, one-light
base24 theme flat is interesting..., but uses blue background...

Can use these in nvim, using the tinted-theming/tinted-vim plugin, and preface the theme with "base16-"

already in my config:
carbonfox (with minor mods), vscode.nvim, vim-moonfly-colors, midnight.nvim, noctis.nvim, slate-old (ported from vim a bit ago...)
don't forget industry scheme...
rodnaph/vim-color-schemes: nightshade, sean, rcg_term, dante, greens, Green, relaxedgreen, fog,

# rofi themes

# Stylix stuff
stylix documentation has suggestions for how to style things: [https://stylix.danth.me/styling.html]

## colorschemes
see the list above of general colorschemes
## other things stylix can set
in the future, it may be possible to use multiple wallpapers ...
See if it is possible to combine the stylix theme with the rofi theme...
fonts can also be set, for the font types serif, sansSerif, monospace, emoji; and sizes for usages.
    - monospace font is set, others have not, sizes are also set, but may be adjusted...
opacity can be set, with limited support.
