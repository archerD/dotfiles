# general colorschemes
some base16 colorschemes:
atelier-seaside, brewer, cupertino, everforest-dark-hard, macintosh, google-dark, measured-light, oxocarbon-dark, papercolor-dark, papercolor-light, pico, pop, primer-dark, selenized-white, spacemacs, standarized-light, still-alive, tube, tokyodark, windows-10, windows-nt
base24 colorschemes:
brogrammer, catppuccin-latte (light), deep-oceanic-next, flat, hardcore, one-black, one-light
base24 theme flat is interesting..., but uses blue background...

Can use these in nvim, using the tinted-theming/tinted-vim plugin, and preface the theme with "base16-"

# nvim colorschemes:

already in my config:
carbonfox (with minor mods), vscode.nvim, vim-moonfly-colors, midnight.nvim, noctis.nvim, slate-old (ported from vim a bit ago...)
don't forget industry scheme...
rodnaph/vim-color-schemes: nightshade, sean, rcg_term, dante, greens, Green, relaxedgreen, fog,
